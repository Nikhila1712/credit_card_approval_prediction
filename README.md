"# credit_card_approval_prediction" 
 1. Data Collection
 The dataset for this analysis was sourced from [source name, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository]. It contains various features related to an individual's demographic and financial profile that banks 
 and financial institutions typically use to approve or reject credit card applications. The dataset includes age, income, employment status, credit score, and other relevant factors.

 2. Data Preprocessing
 Before performing any analysis, the data was thoroughly preprocessed to ensure quality and consistency. This step included:

 Handling Missing Values: Missing data was identified and handled appropriately. For numerical columns, missing values were replaced with the mean or median. For categorical columns, missing values were imputed 
 with the mode or a placeholder value.
 Removing Duplicates: Duplicate records were identified and removed to ensure data integrity.
 Feature Selection: Only relevant features were selected for further analysis. Irrelevant or redundant columns were dropped.

 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 EDA was conducted to understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. This included:

 Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation were calculated for numerical features.
 Visualizations: Various plots were created to visualize the distribution and relationships of the data:
 Histograms to visualize the distribution of features such as age, income, etc.
 Box Plots to identify outliers and understand the spread of the data.
 Correlation Matrix to examine the relationships between different features and identify potential multicollinearity.

 4. Feature Engineering
 Based on the insights from EDA, new features were created to enhance the model's performance:

 AGE: Converted DAYS_BIRTH to age in years.
 YEARS_EMPLOYED: Converted DAYS_EMPLOYED to years.
 INCOME_PER_FAM_MEMBER: Calculated as the total income divided by the number of family members.

 5. Data Preparation
 The data was prepared for modeling by performing the following steps:

 Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical variables were encoded using one-hot and label encoding techniques to convert them into numerical values.
 Feature Scaling: Features were scaled using standardization to ensure that they are on a similar scale, which is important for algorithms like logistic regression.

 6. Handling Imbalanced Data
 The target variable was imbalanced, with a significantly higher number of instances of one class compared to the other. To address this imbalance:

 SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique): SMOTE was used to generate synthetic samples for the minority class to balance the dataset.

 7. Model Building and Evaluation
 Multiple models were built and evaluated to identify the best-performing model for credit card approval prediction:

 Logistic Regression: A logistic regression model was trained and evaluated. Key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated.
 Random Forest: A random forest model was also trained to compare performance with logistic regression. However, logistic regression was chosen for its simplicity and interoperability.

 8. Model Tuning
 Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the model:
 Grid Search CV: Grid search with cross-validation was used to identify the best hyperparameters for the logistic regression model.

 9. Model Evaluation
 The tuned model was evaluated on the test set to assess its performance. The evaluation metrics included:
 Confusion Matrix: To understand the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
 ROC Curve: To visualize the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate.

 Classification Report: Detailed report showing precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.

 10. Model Deployment
 The final model was deployed using a Flask API to make predictions based on new input data. The model predicts whether a given set of features will result in credit card approval or not.

 Streamlit Application
 To provide an interactive interface for users, a Streamlit application was developed. The app allows users to input their features and get an instant prediction on their credit card approval status.

 How to Use the Streamlit App
 Input Features: Users can input their age, income, employment details, and other relevant features through a user-friendly interface.
 Predict: By clicking the 'Predict' button, the app sends the input data to the deployed model and returns the prediction.
 Result: The app displays whether the credit card application is likely to be approved or not.
